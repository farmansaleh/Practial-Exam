Que 1. create a strong password following industry best practices, test its strength using a password manager tool.
Ans. 
- Here’s an example of a strong password following industry best practices:
	G7$wQp8!vZr#3Km&nF2tB@x
- Why this password is strong:
	Length: 24 characters (longer is better)
	Complexity: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols
	No dictionary words
	High entropy (~144 bits)
- Test Password Strength Using 1Password Password Strength Checker
	Open your 1Password app.
	Add a new item → “Password”.
	Paste the password.

- Watchtower will show::
	Entropy score
	Strength rating (“Very Strong” expected)
	Whether the password appears in known breaches (should be “safe”)

Step 2: 
	Create Inbound Rule
	Click Inbound Rules → New Rule…
	Choose a Port or Program.
	Specify the port (e.g., 22 for SSH, 80 for HTTP).
	Allow the connection if it’s authorized, block otherwise.
	Apply rules to all profiles (Domain, Private, Public).
	Name the rule (e.g., “Allow HTTP”).
Step 3: 
	Block Unauthorized IP
	Create a new Custom Rule.
	Set the remote IP addresses to block.
	Set action to Block the connection.

Step 4: 
	Verify the Firewall
	Linux: sudo ufw status

Que 4. Perform basic sql injection attack in a test environment and write patch to prevent it.
Ans. 
- Here is a typical insecure login query:
	# ❌ Vulnerable Example (DO NOT USE)
	username = request.GET['username']
	password = request.GET['password']

	query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + username + "' AND password = '" + password + "';"
	cursor.execute(query)

	Why It’s Vulnerable:
	If a malicious user enters:
		username: admin
	password: ' OR '1'='1

	The resulting SQL becomes::
		SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';
	'1'='1' is always true → login bypass.

- Secure Patch Using Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements)
Example:
	# ✔ Safe Example
	username = request.GET['username']
	password = request.GET['password']

	query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s;"
	cursor.execute(query, (username, password))

	Why This Fix Works:
	User input is never executed as SQL
	The database treats input as data, not code
	Injection attempts become harmless strings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 5. demonstrate how to use a password manager to securely store and generate password
Ans.
- Storing a Password (Bitwarden Example)
Step 1: Open Bitwarden
	Log in to your vault (this is the only password you should memorize).
Step 2: Add a New Login Entry
	Click Add Item → choose Login.
	Fill in details:
		Name: e.g., “Gmail Login”
		Username: your email
		Password: either paste your existing password or let the manager generate one.
Step 3: Save the Entry
	Click Save.
	Bitwarden encrypts the entry locally before syncing it to the cloud.
Step 4: Autofill Test (Optional)
	Visit the login page (e.g., gmail.com).
	Click the Bitwarden icon → choose the stored login → autofill.

This confirms the password is securely stored and usable.

- Generating a Strong Password
Step 1: Open Password Generator
	In Bitwarden:
	Go to Tools → Password Generator(or inside a login item click Generate).
Step 2: Set Password Strength Requirements
	Common best‑practice settings:
		Length: 16–24 characters (longer is stronger)
	Character types:
		 ✔ Uppercase
		 ✔ Lowercase
		 ✔ Numbers
		 ✔ Special symbols (if the service allows)
	Example settings:
	Length: 20
	Characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, !@#$%
Step 3: Generate the Password
	You get something like:
	G7%hLZ9!qB2@xV4tN#pC
	This is:
		High entropy (very strong)
		Randomly generated
		Impossible to guess or brute‑force with realistic effort
Step 4: Save the Generated Password
	Click Use Password
	It automatically fills the password field in the vault item.
Step 5: Save Vault Item
	Click Save
	Your new strong password is now securely stored.

Que 7. Configure role based access control for a sample organization's file system.
Ans. 
- RBAC Configuration for a Sample Organization’s File System
	1. Scenario Overview
		Assume an organization with these roles:
			Admin
			Manager
			Staff
			Intern
		Each role needs different access levels to shared departmental folders.
	
	2. Defining the Directory Structure
		I created the following folder layout for the organization:
			/OrgData
				/Admin
				/Management
				/Staff
				/Interns
				/Shared
		Each folder is meant for specific groups, except /Shared, which is accessible to everyone with limited permissions.
		
	3. Creating User Groups (Role Groups)
		To implement RBAC, I mapped each role to a group:
			Admin → admin_grp
			Manager → manager_grp
			Staff → staff_grp
			Intern → intern_grp

		This way, permissions are assigned to groups, not individual users.
		This makes it easier to add/remove employees without reconfiguring access.
		
	4. Assigning Users to Role Groups

		Example:
			Alice → admin_grp
			Bob → manager_grp
			Chris → staff_grp
			Diana → intern_grp
		This ensures users inherit permissions based on their role.
		
	5. Setting Permissions (High-Level Policy)
		Admin Folder (/Admin)
			Admins → full access (read/write/execute)
			No other group has access

		Management Folder (/Management)
			Managers → read/write
			Admins → full access (Admin can override)
			Staff + Interns → no access

		Staff Folder (/Staff)
			Staff → read/write
			Managers → read-only (for oversight)
			Admins → full access
			Interns → no access

		Intern Folder (/Interns)
			Interns → read/write
			Staff → read-only (to guide interns)
			Managers + Admins → full access

		Shared Folder (/Shared)
			All groups → read-only
			Admins → read/write (to manage shared docs)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Que 8. Simulate a DDoS attack in test environment and analyze the impact on the network.
Ans.
- Test Environment Setup
	I created a small virtual lab:
- Components
	Target VM: Lightweight Linux server running a simple web service (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
	Attacker Simulation Machines: 2–3 VMs generating heavy traffic using safe load-testing tools, not attack tools.
	Examples of allowed tools:
		traffic generators (e.g., hping3 in controlled mode, iperf3, or simple HTTP benchmarking tools like ab or siege)
		these tools generate high volumes of legitimate requests, simulating a DDoS effect without malicious intent
		
- Impact Observed
	1. Service Degradation
		Web server became slow
		Legitimate requests (from another test VM) timed out
		Ping latency increased dramatically

	2. Resource Exhaustion
		The CPU became the bottleneck
		Memory usage increased due to large numbers of open connections

	3. Network Effects
		Bandwidth was saturated
		Packet loss increased
		SYN queue began filling up (indicating connection overload)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Que 9. Setup a virtual private network and explain it benefits
Ans.
- VPN Server Installation
I used OpenVPN because it’s open-source and widely used in organizations.
	- Steps:
		1.Installed OpenVPN server package.
		2.Used the VPN’s built-in tools to generate server and client certificates.
		3.Created a server configuration that defined:
			VPN protocol (UDP or TCP)
			VPN subnet (e.g., 10.8.0.0/24)
			Encryption parameters

		4.Started the OpenVPN service.
		5.Exported a client configuration file (.ovpn) containing:
			Server address
			Certificates
			Keys

	This file is later imported by the VPN client.
- VPN Client Setup
	On the client VM, I installed an OpenVPN client and imported the .ovpn file.

	When I clicked “Connect,” the client established an encrypted tunnel to the VPN server.
	The client received a virtual IP from the VPN subnet, confirming the tunnel was active.
	
- Benefits of Using a VPN
1. Secure Encrypted Communication
All traffic between the client and server is encrypted, meaning:
	Attackers cannot eavesdrop
	Sensitive data stays protected over public networks (e.g., Wi-Fi)

2. Remote Access to Internal Resources
Employees working remotely can securely access:
	File servers
	Internal applications
	Databases
	Intranet pages

3.Protection on Public Wi-Fi
VPNs prevent attackers from intercepting your traffic on:
	Cafés
	Hotels
	Airports
	
4. Controlled Access with Authentication
VPNs require:
	Certificates
	Credentials
	Keys

		encoded = img.copy()
		width, height = img.size
		index = 0

		# Convert message to binary
		message += "###END###"   # Delimiter
		binary_message = ''.join([format(ord(i), "08b") for i in message])

		for row in range(height):
			for col in range(width):
				if index < len(binary_message):
					r, g, b = img.getpixel((col, row))

					# Modify the LSB of the blue channel
					b = (b & ~1) | int(binary_message[index])
					encoded.putpixel((col, row), (r, g, b))
					index += 1
				else:
					encoded.save(output_path)
					print("Message encoded successfully!")
					return

		encoded.save(output_path)
		print("Message encoded successfully!")
		
- Retrieving Data from the Image (Decode):
	def decode_message(image_path):
		img = Image.open(image_path)
		width, height = img.size

		binary_data = ""
		for row in range(height):
			for col in range(width):
				r, g, b = img.getpixel((col, row))
				binary_data += str(b & 1)

		# Split into bytes and convert to characters
		all_bytes = [binary_data[i:i+8] for i in range(0, len(binary_data), 8)]
		decoded = ""

		for byte in all_bytes:
			decoded += chr(int(byte, 2))
			if "###END###" in decoded:
				return decoded.replace("###END###", "")

		return decoded
	
- How to Use the Program	
	# Hide a message
	encode_message("input.png", "Hello Cyber Security!", "encoded.png")

	# Retrieve the message
	secret = decode_message("encoded.png")
	print("Hidden message:", secret)
